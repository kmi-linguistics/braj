# Braj Bhasha
Repository for all codes, data and resources on Braj Bhasha that is being developed at the Institute.

Currently the data directory contains the manually-annotated gold dataset annotated with POS tags - both BIS tagset and UD tasget (automatically mapped from BIS tagset using our mapper, included in the 'utils' directory). It also includes the automatically tagged data (inside the 'auto-pos' directory) using our POS tagger. The tagger itself is included inside the tools directory. All the scripts require Python 3 to run.

These are being made available for further research and expansion at no cost. However, if you are interested in making a commercial usage of these resources, please contact the creators of this project.

More tools and data is expected to be added and these ones modified in the future.
